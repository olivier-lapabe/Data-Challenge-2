Structural ideas:
- Do algorithm that classifies gender to understand gender representation in test dataset. --> Guigui nouveau Runner (Gender_runner.py)
- Calculate error on gender deciles on training dataset (e.g., between 0.3 and 0.7). 
  If not similar, try to define first if a test picture is male or female. --> Olivier sur fichier EDA.ipynb
- Have error as loss function for training. --> Guillaume - nouvelle fonction de loss à définir (par ex dans utils)

Optimization ideas:
- Train by Cross validation
- Train with different batch size
- Train with other models
- Train with other loss function
- Train with other Adam parameters (starting with learning rate)
- Train with other optimizer than Adam
