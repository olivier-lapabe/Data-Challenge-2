Ideas:
- Have train and val split to have same gender representation
- Remove genders that are unclear (e.g., between 0.3 and 0.7)
- Train with different batch size
- Train with other models
- Train with other loss function
- Train with other Adam parameters (starting with learning rate)
- Train with other optimizer than Adam
- Occlusion is higher for women than men. Add first step top determine if picture is man or woman ?
